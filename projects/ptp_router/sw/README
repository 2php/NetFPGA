INSTALLATION
(1) Type "make install" in the sw/ directory. This copies over SCONE and patches for PTP support.
(2) cd into scone-ptp/ and type make. This creates the scone_ptp executable.

DEVELOPMENT
(1) Modify the code under scone-ptp/
(2) cd ../ from scone-ptp
(3) do "make patch" to create a new patch

NOTES
-- The interface states are configured via the ptp.conf. See the included file for an example.
-- scone_ptp dumps SYNC and PDELAY information to sync.log and pdelay.log, respectively.
-- To silence all the debug output, change the debug_printf macro in or_ptp_common.h to be nothing.

OUTSTANDING ISSUES
The hardware implementation can only timestamp a single incoming packet at once. This can cause race 
conditions if two PTP packets arrive without an intervening read of the timestamp. This problem will
likely get fixed in the future, but for now we wait 50 ms between sending PTP packets on the same port.
